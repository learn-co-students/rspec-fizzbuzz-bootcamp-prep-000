#I need a method called #fizzbuzz that accepts one argument.
#When I call that method and pass it a number divisible by 3, that method should return the string "Fizz".
#When I call that method and pass it a number divisible by 5, that method should return the string "Buzz".
#When I call that method and pass it a number divisible by 3 and 5, that method should return the string "FizzBuzz".
#When I call that method and pass it a number not divisible by 3 or 5, that method should return nil.
